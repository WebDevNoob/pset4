CS50 Problem Set 4
I really enjoyed this problem. Mock forensics on BMP and JPG images. Had to dive into understanding Hexidecimal and Bitwise operations. 

Uncover an image in the BMP image by switching the color of key pixels. 

Recover images "lost" in memory using knowledge about starting jpg bits.
