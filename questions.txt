0.  # BMP: 24-bit or 16 million 
    # GIF: 256 colors
    # JPEG: 24-bit or 16 million
    # PNG: 24-bit or 16 million
1.  GIF
2.  Lossy compression reduces file size by changing
    its atributes, while lossless trys to retain image
    fidelity. 
3.  JPEG
4.  The data isn't touched, just the file pathing. 
5.  Replace data stored with NULL or /0
6.  stdint.h is a library of macros dealing with data types. 
    it sets min and max for datatypes. 
7.  You would use uint8_t and uint16_t to improve protability of
    your program. DWORD might not exist!
8.  BYTE: 8 bits
    DWORD: 32 bits 
    WORD: 16 bits
    LONG: 32 bits
9.  B then M
10. bfSize is the size of entire file. Headers, padding...
    biSize is the size of the image, minus headers, padding...
11. If biHeight is negative the image is read starting from 
    the upper left side.
12. biBitCount
13. If the file didn't previously exist it will NULL error
14. The third argument to fread will always be 1 for us because
    we only want to scan the file once
15. Padding will be equal to 1
16. fseek can change the pointers position in the file
17. SEEK_CUR is the current pointer posistion of the file
18. Turning the red pixels white allowed me to see a student holding a snake(?).
